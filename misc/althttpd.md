The Althttpd Webserver
======================

Althttpd is a simple webserver that has run the <https://sqlite.org/> website
since 2004.  Althttpd strives for simplicity, security, and low resource
usage.

The code and documentation for Althttpd was originally hosted here in the
documentation source code.  But on 2020-12-01 it was moved to its
[own repository](https://sqlite.org/althttpd/).  Visit the new repository
for the latest updates.
