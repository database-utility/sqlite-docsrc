<p>
SQLite is a high-reliability storage solution.  It does not give
problems.  It just works.

<p>
The high-reliability of SQLite is proven in practice.
SQLite has been used without problems in multiple billions of smart-phones, 
IoT devices, and desktop applications, around the world, and for almost two
decades.

<p>
SQLite responds gracefully to system errors.  Obscure out-of-memory and
I/O errors are reported back up to the application.  These error reporting
paths are all carefully tested to ensure they will always work.

<p>
SQLite is resilient in the face of corrupt inputs, including maliciously
designed database files and SQL strings.  Extensive fuzz-testing ensures
that corrupt inputs will not lead to crashes or undefined behavior, but
will instead cause sensible errors to be reported back to the application.

<p>
SQLite is built using a 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B|DO-178B]-inspired process.
The [testing|testing standards] for SQLite are among the highest for
commercial software.

<p>
SQLite is [copyright|open-source] but it is not open-contribution.
All the code in SQLite is written by a small team of experts.
The project does not accept "pull requests" or patches from 
anonymous passers-by on the internet.

<p>
The developers of SQLite intend to support the product through
the year 2050.  To this end, the source code is carefully documented
to promote long-term maintainability.  We prefer mature and stable
over trendy and cutting-edge.

<p>
All of these factors combine to make SQLite a very trouble-free
software library.
