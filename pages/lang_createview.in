<h1>Description</h1>

<p>^The CREATE VIEW command assigns a name to a pre-packaged 
[SELECT] statement. 
^Once the view is created, it can be used in the FROM clause
of another [SELECT] in place of a table name.
</p>

<p>^If the "TEMP" or "TEMPORARY" keyword occurs in between "CREATE"
and "VIEW" then the view that is created is only visible to the
[database connection] that created it and is automatically deleted when
the database connection is closed.</p>

<p> ^If a <yyterm>schema-name</yyterm> is specified, then the view 
is created in the specified database.
^It is an error to specify both a <yyterm>schema-name</yyterm>
and the TEMP keyword on a VIEW, unless the <yyterm>schema-name</yyterm> 
is "temp".
^If no schema name is specified, and the TEMP keyword is not present,
the VIEW is created in the main database.</p>

<p>^You cannot [DELETE], [INSERT], or [UPDATE] a view.  ^Views are read-only 
in SQLite.  ^However, in many cases you can use an
[INSTEAD OF trigger] on the view to accomplish 
the same thing.  ^Views are removed 
with the [DROP VIEW] command.</p>

<p>^If a <yyterm>column-name</yyterm> list follows 
the <yyterm>view-name</yyterm>, then that list determines
the names of the columns for the view.  ^If the <yyterm>column-name</yyterm>
list is omitted, then the names of the columns in the view are derived
from the names of the result-set columns in the [select-stmt].
The use of <yyterm>column-name</yyterm> list is recommended.  Or, if
<yyterm>column-name</yyterm> list is omitted, then the result
columns in the [SELECT] statement that defines the view should have
well-defined names using the 
"[result-column|AS column-alias]" syntax.
SQLite allows you to create views that depend on automatically 
generated column names, but you should avoid using them since the 
rules used to generate column names are not a defined part of the
interface and might change in future releases of SQLite.

<p>The <yyterm>column-name</yyterm> list syntax was added in
SQLite versions 3.9.0 ([dateof:3.9.0]).
