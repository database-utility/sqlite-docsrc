<p>^The REINDEX command is used to delete and recreate indices from scratch.
This is useful when the definition of a collation sequence has changed, or
when there are [indexes on expressions] involving a function whose definition
has changed.
</p>

<p>^If the REINDEX keyword is not followed by a collation-sequence or database 
object identifier, then all indices in all attached databases are rebuilt.

<p>^If the REINDEX keyword is followed by a collation-sequence name, then
all indices in all attached databases that use the named collation sequences
are recreated. 

<p>^Or, if the argument attached to the REINDEX identifies a specific 
database table, then all indices attached to the database table are rebuilt. 
^If it identifies a specific database index, then just that index is recreated.

<p>^For a command of the form "REINDEX <i>name</i>", a match
against <yyterm>collation-name</yyterm> takes precedence over a match
against <yyterm>index-name</yyterm> or <yyterm>table-name</yyterm>.
This ambiguity in the syntax may be avoided by always specifying a
<yyterm>schema-name</yyterm> when reindexing a specific table or index.
