<p>^The DROP TRIGGER statement removes a trigger created by the 
[CREATE TRIGGER] statement. ^Once removed, the trigger definition is no
longer present in the [sqlite_schema] (or sqlite_temp_schema) table and is
not fired by any subsequent INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements.

<p>^Note that triggers are automatically dropped when the associated table is
dropped.
