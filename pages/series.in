<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The generate_series(START,STOP,STEP) [table-valued function] is a
[loadable extension] included in the SQLite source tree, and compiled into
the [command-line shell].  The generate_series() table has one visible
result column named "value" holding integer values
and a number of rows determined by the
parameters START, STOP, and STEP.  The first row of the table has
a value of START.  Subsequent rows increase by STEP up to STOP.

<p>The generate_series() table has additional, hidden columns
named "start", "stop", and "step" whose values are the effective
values of START, STOP and STEP as provided or defaulted.
It also has a rowid, accessible by its usual names.

<p>Omitted parameters take on default values.  STEP defaults to 1.
STOP defaults to 4294967295.  The START parameter is required
as of version 3.37.0 ([dateof:3.37.0]) and later and an error will
be raised if START is omitted or has a self-referential or otherwise
uncomputable value.  Older versions used a default of 0 for START.
The legacy behavior can be obtained from recent code by compiling
with -DZERO_ARGUMENT_GENERATE_SERIES.

<h2>Equivalent Recursive Common Table Expression</h2>

<p>The generate_series table can be simulated using a
[recursive common table expression].  If the three parameters
are $start, $end, and $step, then the equivalent common table
expression is:

<codeblock>
WITH RECURSIVE generate_series(value) AS (
  SELECT $start
  UNION ALL
  SELECT value+$step FROM generate_series
   WHERE value+$step&lt;=$end
) ...
</codeblock>

<p>The common table expression works without having to load an
extension.  On the other hand, the extension is easier to program
and faster.

<h1>Usage Examples</h1>

<p>Generate all multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100:

<codeblock>
SELECT value FROM generate_series(5,100,5);
</codeblock>

<p>Generate the 20 random integer values:

<codeblock>
SELECT random() FROM generate_series(1,20);
</codeblock>

<p>Find the name of every customer whose account number
   is an even multiple of 100 between 10000 and 20000.

<codeblock>
SELECT customer.name
  FROM customer, generate_series(10000,20000,100)
 WHERE customer.id=value;
/* or */
SELECT name FROM customer
 WHERE id IN (SELECT value
                FROM generate_series(10000,20000,200));
</codeblock>
