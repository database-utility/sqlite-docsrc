<p>^This statement detaches an additional database connection previously 
attached using the [ATTACH] statement.  
^When not in [shared cache mode], 
it is possible to have the same database file attached multiple times using 
different names, and detaching one connection to a file will leave the 
others intact.</p>

<p>
^In [shared cache mode], attempting to attach the same database file more
than once results in an error.
