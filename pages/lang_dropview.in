<p>^The DROP VIEW statement removes a view created by the [CREATE VIEW] 
  statement. ^The view definition is removed from the database schema, but 
  no actual data in the underlying base tables is modified.

<p>^(The view to drop is identified by the view-name and optional 
  schema-name specified as part of the DROP VIEW statement. This 
  reference is resolved using the standard procedure for [object resolution].)^

<p>
  ^If the specified view cannot be found and the IF EXISTS clause is not 
  present, it is an error. ^If the specified view cannot be found and an IF
  EXISTS clause is present in the DROP VIEW statement, then the statement
  is a no-op.
